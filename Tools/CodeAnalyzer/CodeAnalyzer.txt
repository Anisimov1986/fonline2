Inclusive is the time spent in the function and its callees, exclusive is the time spent in
the function itself. So all of exclusive should sum up to 100% and inclusive should decrease
as you descend the call tree.
More precisely:
 inclusive is % of times when the function was in the callstack when a sample was taken
 exclusive is % of times when the function was on top of the callstack.

{941}{}{Simmons, how many goddamn times do I have to tell you to keep your men in line?! You bunch are tough motherfuckers, but this doesn't mean you can shit on the old man's orders! You were told to take the loot and scram, this was supposed to be a quick job, not some fucking picnick! On top of that, you failed to get them on time, and when you finally did, it was just on the Junktown's outskirts, what the fuck, man? This is your final warning, so don't fuck this up. The coordinates are uploaded to this holo, your new target is a caravan from San Fran. Intercept them at the overpass in two days. You can take what you want, no restrictions, but most importantly, leave absolutely no survivors. This is supposed to look like a ordinary raid. The main target is the dwarf merchant, he's got some important papers on him. Don't even fucking dare to come back without them! I've also uploaded the new safehouse location, meet me there when the job's done. And remember, no straggling, see you there in three days.}
